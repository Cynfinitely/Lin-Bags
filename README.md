This is a full stack project created using the MERN stack and Tailwind CSS. The project is a simple e-commerce application that allows admin to create, view, update, and delete users/products. And Users can see products and add to cart. It also includes authentication and authorization functionality to ensure that only authorized users can access certain features.

## Features

The application includes the following features:

- User registration and login
- Product creation and deletion
- Product updating
- User profile editing
- Password resetting
- Authentication and authorization
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to create this project:

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React
- Node.js
- Tailwind CSS

## Installation

To install and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Cynfinitely/fs12-fullstack.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd fs12-fullstack && npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables
"NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=<your MongoDB URI>
JWT_SECRET=<your secret key>"
4. Start the server: `npm run dev`
5. Start the client: `cd client && npm start`

## Project Structure

The project follows a typical MERN stack directory structure, with the server code in the `server` directory and the client code in the `client` directory. The server code uses the `express` framework and the `mongoose` library for interacting with the MongoDB database. The client code uses the `react` library and the `axios` library for making HTTP requests to the server.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my skills in full stack web development using the MERN stack and Tailwind CSS. The task management application includes all the basic features required for a typical CRUD application, as well as authentication and authorization functionality. I hope this project will help me demonstrate my abilities as a junior full stack developer to potential employers.
